Building and Running with Docker on localhost

The following has been tested in the following environment:
- Windows 10 PRO
- Docker for Windows using WSL2
- git-bash

A docker image of ofbiz can be built based on your checked out workspace using command:
./gradlew --no-daemon buildDockerImage

This will build an image, tagged ofbiz:latest, which uses the derby database driver and loaded with default data.

To run a container based on this image that is cleaned up on termination:
docker run -it --rm --publish 8080:8080 --publish 8443:8443 ofbiz:latest

Visit https://localhost:8443/partymgr
Username / Password: admin / ofbiz

Use Ctrl-c to terminate the container.
